# Store management websitein Laravel

A full Laravel website to manage a products store.
I ised the laravel library [laravel-crud-generator](https://github.com/awais-vteams/laravel-crud-generator) to manage easily manage crud operation template (vue, model, controller) for main models. Then I overrided them to add the right store management logic with customization to handle image upload and display, statistics display.
